# 📊 Polymarket Premium Dashboard

> **TL;DR for Reviewers**
> - Analytics-only, read-only dashboard (no execution)
> - No simulated or fabricated performance
> - Execution hard-disabled by code (execution gate)
> - Uses public data with mock fallback today
> - Designed to improve decision quality, not trade frequency
> - Ready to connect to live Polymarket CLOB data post-approval

## 📌 Project Summary

**Polymarket Premium Dashboard** is a **read-only analytics and decision-support interface** built specifically for Polymarket prediction markets.

The dashboard focuses on **market structure, liquidity behavior, and confidence formation**, transforming raw market data into structured, interpretable analytics — **without executing, simulating, or automating trades**.

The objective is to help users make **more cautious, informed, and disciplined decisions**, rather than encouraging frequent or impulsive trading.

---

## 🔐 Execution Policy (Critical)

This project is intentionally designed as **analytics-only**.

- ❌ No order placement  
- ❌ No transaction signing  
- ❌ No bots, relayers, or automation  
- ❌ No simulated or fabricated PnL  

Execution is **hard-disabled at the code level** via a global execution gate.

Any attempt to enable execution without official Polymarket Builder / CLOB API approval will fail by design.

---

## 📉 Why Some Analytics Are Empty (By Design)

Some analytics panels (e.g. **Win Rate**, **PnL**, **Entry Timing**) may appear empty.

This is **intentional**.

- The dashboard does **not fabricate historical results**
- No simulated trades or backfilled performance are shown
- Metrics populate **only after real Polymarket market resolutions**

Empty analytics reflect **data integrity and risk awareness**, not missing functionality.

---

## 🔁 Why Mock Data Exists Alongside Real Data

The dashboard currently displays **mock data together with real public data**.

This design serves three purposes:

1. **UI and model validation** without execution risk  
2. **User learning**, allowing exploration of analytics without financial pressure  
3. **Safe progression** toward live data once Builder API access is approved  

Mock data is clearly labeled and is **never mixed with real performance metrics**.

---

## 🔑 Why Builder API Access Matters

Today’s prediction market environment is often influenced by **mixed emotions and conflicting information** shared across social platforms.

Without accurate, real-time market data, users may act on incomplete signals, emotional narratives, or misleading liquidity conditions — increasing the likelihood of poor decisions.

Builder API access enables this dashboard to provide **higher-fidelity, real-time analytics** that help users:

- Filter noise and emotionally-driven information  
- Understand true liquidity and orderbook depth  
- Detect confidence decay and late-stage momentum  
- Evaluate markets more cautiously and deliberately  

The goal is **not** to eliminate risk or promise outcomes, but to improve **information quality**, allowing users to protect themselves from avoidable mistakes in emotionally charged markets.

## 🔁 Demo-Safe → Live Data Transition

### Current Mode (Demo / Review Safe)
- Public Polymarket Gamma API (read-only)
- Deterministic mock data fallback
- No execution or order routing
- No simulated outcomes
- Analytics remain empty until real resolutions occur

### Post-Approval Mode (Live Data)
After Polymarket Builder / CLOB API approval:

- Mock feeds are replaced with **live Polymarket market data**
- Analytics populate **only from real outcomes**
- Signals remain **decision-support only**
- Users execute trades manually on Polymarket’s official interface

🚫 **What does NOT change after approval**
- No automated trading
- No bot execution
- No custody of user funds
- No artificial volume generation

---

### Design Principle

> **The dashboard is designed to improve trade quality and decision confidence rather than automate or increase trade frequency, ensuring any resulting activity is organic and user-driven.**

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### High-Confidence Signal Grid
- Model-derived confidence
- Directional analytical bias (**Leans YES / Leans NO**)
- Resolution countdown
- Manual market navigation

Directional labels represent **analytical bias only**, not trade actions.

---

### Liquidity Heatmap
- Liquidity clustering
- Support / resistance zones
- Whale-scale liquidity detection
- Timeframes: **5m / 15m / 1h**

---

### Market Depth & Spread Analytics
- Buy vs sell pressure
- Spread inefficiencies
- Early imbalance detection

---

### Performance Analytics (Resolution-Based)
- Confidence vs Win Rate
- Entry Timing vs Edge Decay
- Decision journaling for learning

Metrics activate **only after real market resolutions**.

---

## 🧊 UI Philosophy

- ❌ No fake performance
- ❌ No execution shortcuts
- ❌ No misleading backtests
- ✅ Clear analytics
- ✅ Trader-first UX
- ✅ Builder-review safe

The UI is **stable and intentionally frozen** for review.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Modular analytics engine
- Polymarket-ready API abstraction
- Explicit execution gate (read-only enforcement)

## 🛠 Backend / Data Pipeline (NEW)

The repository is being productized into a **Python 3.10+ / FastAPI / asyncio**
ingestion + analytics service with **TimescaleDB**, built around a hard
**Live | Mock | Resolved** 3-schema separation. Frontend (this dashboard)
consumes the analytics engine.

- **Backend:** `backend/` — FastAPI app + ingestors (Gamma, CLOB REST+WS, Mock,
  Resolved) + analytics engine
- **DB schema:** `db/migrations/001_create_schemas.sql` (TimescaleDB) and
  `db/demo_sqlite.sql` (identical-shape SQLite for the no-Docker demo)
- **Infra:** `infra/docker-compose.yml` — TimescaleDB + backend (monitoring-ready)
- **Quick demo:** `cd backend && python -m scripts.demo`
  (see `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/db-schema-draft.md`, `docs/DEMO.md`)
